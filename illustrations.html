<h2>An Artist on all Fronts</h2>
<p><strong>As well as being a great writer, Kurt was a talented visual artist as well. 
  This was first properly shown to the world in his 7th novel Breakfast of Champions, which was littered with his felt tip illustratons detailing different subjects of his story.
  He continued to include the occaisonal doodle in his books until his retirement, but as he got older he also focused on more standalone and abstract work. </strong></p>
