  <h1>Kurt's Life</h1>
  <article>
	  <p>Kurt Vonnegut, as you probably know by now, was an American writer. 
He wrote over a span of 50 years, finishing 14 novels and dozens of short stories, predominately written in sci-fi, narritive fiction, and/or satire. I've summed up his biography into pre-war and post-war</p>
<section class="profile">
  <h2>Early Life (pre-war) </h2>
  <p>Kurt was born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, the culture of which has influenced his writing, having characters from Indiana showing up in his stories and using Indionapolis or similar cities as a setting.
Kurt attended Cornel University, but dropped out to join the Army during World War Two. 
He was captured as a prisoner of war, and kept in the German city of Dresden.
</p>
  <p>Near the end of the war was the bombing of dresdon, which Kurt survived by hiding in a meat locker of a slaughterhouse.</p>
</section>
<section class="profile">
  <h2>Later Life (post-war)</h2>
  <p>This event deeply impacted Kurt, and was the main source of inspiration for his best-selling novel, Slaughterhouse Five, over 2 decades later.
After the war, he returned home, married, and began writing short stories while working as a salesman for General Electric.
His sister, who he was very close with, then died of cancer very shortly after her husband died in a car accident, orphaning their 3 children.
Kurt adopted these 3 along with his own 3 children, and in the mean time published his first novel.
It was positively reviewed, but didn't sell very well. </p>
  <p>Kurt did not give up though, and continued writing and publishing novels for the next 30 years, writing cult-classics like Breakfast of Champions and Cat's Cradle, as well as best sellers such as Slaughterhouse Five.
Later on in his life, Kurt focused more on essays and slowly eased himself into retirement, dying at the age of 84 in 2007.
His impact on American literature cannot be understated, with the novel Slaughterhouse Five kickstarting the postmodern movement. 
Despite his many hardships and tragedies, he always found a way to find beauty and hope in life and put them to pages.
