  <h1>Kurt Vonnegut jr.</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>Why am I making a website about him?</h2>
    <p>Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite writer, and the man responsible for my love of reading. </p>
    <p>One day a depressed and confused 14 year old me picked up "Mother Night" and a single sentence from the preface had hooked me until the end.
      That sentence is this: </p>
    <p>"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be." </p>
    <p>Since finishing that book in a single long night, I've since read all 14 novels of Kurt Vonneguts, a majority of his short stories and essays, as well as probably closer to a hundred novel from other writers.
      Kurt has remained my favorite though, and for good reason. </p>
    <p> His style is incredibly unique. 
      It's weird, confusing, sad, funny, and deeply emotional. 
      His characters are simple yet real, his plots are complicated yet understandable, and his writing is poiniant, unembelished, and resonant.
      He has a way with words, characters, and stories that I haven't seen in a writer before or since. </p>
