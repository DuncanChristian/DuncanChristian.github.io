  <h1>Kurt Blurts</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Kurt had a very unique way with words. He saw the world from an almost alien perspective and was able to strip down everything to it's most pure and absurd. The joy, sorrow, comedy, and beauty of the world becomes aparent in these sentences scattered throughout his writing. I've dubbed them "Kurt Blurts".</p>
